## Installation

## usage

```
PatchDiff instance wraps an object

it has the following api

patcher.get(path) // returns the value at path of object (json path), this is a reference

patcher.remove(path) removes the value at path

patcher.apply(patch, path) // this is the most important one, it allows you to patch the wrapped object with partial object (the patch)

the patch structure should be the same on a specific path, undefined values are ignored while every other is treated as assiginemnts
```
